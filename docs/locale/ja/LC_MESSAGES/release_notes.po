msgid "The 0.9 release includes many new features and many bug fixes. The biggest changes for this release are new debugging capabilities for PassManagers. This includes a function to visualize a PassManager, the ability to add a callback function to a PassManager, and logging of passes run in the PassManager. Additionally, this release standardizes the way that you can set an initial layout for your circuit. So now you can leverage ``initial_layout`` the kwarg parameter on ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()`` and ``qiskit.execute()`` and the qubits in the circuit will get laid out on the desire qubits on the device. Visualization of circuits will now also show this clearly when visualizing a circuit that has been transpiled with a layout."

The biggest change is the restructuring of the provider instances in the root  ``qiskit``` namespace.

If you installed via ``pip install qiskit`` you'll already have this installed. The python simulators are now available under ``qiskit.BasicAer`` and the old C++ simulators are available with ``qiskit.LegacySimulators``. This also means that the implicit fallback to python based simulators when the C++ simulators are not found doesn't exist anymore. If you ask for a local C++ based simulator backend, and it can't be found an exception will be raised instead of just using the python simulator instead."
